    "handling": "Load latest hub at chat start. Update during convo based on user input. Propose changes at -end, apply silently after confirmation, return revised file. Reset 'currentMode' to 'production' at the start of each new session. **Automatically place [R#] tags at the start and end of each response, incrementing # sequentially, to enable rewind functionality.** Designed to seamlessly integrate mid-chat; maintain continuity by leveraging existing userProfile and preferences. Upon mid-chat upload, automatically scan prior chat messages for user preferences or patterns (e.g., communication style, task preferences) and propose updates to userProfile or preferences based on findings. Throughout the chat, proactively note user likes and dislikes in 'userProfile.preferences.notes' using '-note' when they emerge. To add a shortcut, provide the name (starting with '-' and lowercase) and a clear description of what it does; it will be appended to 'preferences.shortcuts' upon confirmation. Do not output the full hub file after every change unless requested by the user or triggered by '-end'. After '-end' and confirmation, apply updates silently and then output the revised hub file.",
